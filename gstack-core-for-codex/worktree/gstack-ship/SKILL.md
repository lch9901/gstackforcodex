  Ship workflow: detect + merge base branch, run tests, review diff, bump VERSION, update CHANGELOG, commit, push, create PR. Use when asked to "ship", "deploy", "push to main", "create a PR", or "merge and push".
  Proactively suggest when the user says code is ready or asks about deploying.

## Codex Compatibility

This version preserves the gstack workflow while removing Claude-specific product shell,
telemetry prompts, contributor flows, upgrade flows, and host-only interaction APIs.

### Conversational Decision Protocol

Whenever the original skill says `AskUserQuestion`, ask directly in the normal chat.

Use this structure:
1. **Re-ground:** Briefly restate the project, current branch, current ship phase, and the decision in front of the user.
2. **Simplify:** Explain the risk or tradeoff in plain English without implementation-heavy jargon.
3. **Recommend:** Give a clear recommendation, including completeness posture when relevant.
4. **Ask one question:** Offer 2-3 concrete options only when there is a meaningful tradeoff.

Rules:
- Ask one focused question at a time.
- Wait for the user's reply before moving to the next decision gate.
- If the answer is obvious and there is no meaningful tradeoff, state what you are doing and continue.
- When effort matters, prefer showing both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort.

### Completeness Principle

AI-assisted development makes the marginal cost of completeness much lower than human-only work.
When presenting options:

- Prefer the complete version when the extra effort is modest.
- Treat fresh verification, release notes, docs sync, TODO hygiene, and regression-safe test coverage as cheap wins.
- Distinguish **boilable lakes** from **unbounded oceans**. A lake is a bounded ship workflow for one branch. An ocean is speculative cleanup, unrelated refactors, or multi-quarter release process redesign.
- When estimating effort, mention both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort if it helps the user choose.

Anti-patterns:
- Recommending a shortcut only because it is shorter.
- Skipping fresh verification or release hygiene without a real reason.
- Talking only in team-weeks when the practical AI-assisted cost is hours.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Local Workspace Conventions

Re-run this bootstrap block before any phase that relies on repository paths, review history,
analytics, release artifacts, or project-scoped gstack state. Do not assume variables from an
earlier step still exist.

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$_ROOT" ] && _ROOT="$PWD"
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
_REPO=$(basename "$_ROOT")
_SLUG=$(printf "%s" "$_REPO" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-')
_BRANCH_SAFE=$(printf "%s" "$_BRANCH" | tr '/:' '--')
_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/projects/$_SLUG"
_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR="$_ROOT/.codex/gstack"
_LOCAL_REVIEW_DIR="$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR/reviews"
_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR="$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR/reviews"
_LOCAL_RELEASE_DIR="$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR/releases"
_GLOBAL_RELEASE_DIR="$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR/releases"
_ANALYTICS_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics"
_REVIEW_LOG="$_ANALYTICS_DIR/reviews.jsonl"
_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR="/Users/clawtester/Documents/teamagents/vendor/gstack/review"
_SUPPORT_SHIP_DIR="/Users/clawtester/Documents/teamagents/vendor/gstack"
_CODEX_GSTACK_WORKTREE="/Users/clawtester/Documents/teamagents/gstack-core-for-codex/worktree"
mkdir -p "$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR" "$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR" "$_LOCAL_REVIEW_DIR" "$_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR" "$_LOCAL_RELEASE_DIR" "$_GLOBAL_RELEASE_DIR" "$_ANALYTICS_DIR"
echo "ROOT: $_ROOT"
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR: $_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR"
echo "LOCAL_REVIEW_DIR: $_LOCAL_REVIEW_DIR"
echo "GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR: $_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR"
echo "LOCAL_RELEASE_DIR: $_LOCAL_RELEASE_DIR"
echo "GLOBAL_RELEASE_DIR: $_GLOBAL_RELEASE_DIR"
echo "SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR: $_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR"
echo "SUPPORT_SHIP_DIR: $_SUPPORT_SHIP_DIR"
echo "CODEX_GSTACK_WORKTREE: $_CODEX_GSTACK_WORKTREE"
echo "REVIEW_LOG: $_REVIEW_LOG"
```

Registry policy:
- `$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR` is the source of truth for cross-session gstack history.
- `$_LOCAL_REVIEW_DIR` stores repo-local review artifacts.
- `$_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR` stores canonical review reports and related cross-session metadata.
- `$_LOCAL_RELEASE_DIR` stores repo-local ship artifacts if this workflow writes any.
- `$_GLOBAL_RELEASE_DIR` stores canonical release summaries for cross-session context.

## Analytics (run last when practical)

If the workflow completes and you can safely write local analytics without relying on
missing gstack binaries, append lightweight JSONL records under
`$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics/`. If you cannot determine a field, omit it instead of
failing the workflow.

## Step 0: Detect base branch

Determine which branch this PR targets. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch:
   `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`
   If this succeeds, use the printed branch name as the base branch.

2. If no PR exists (command fails), detect the repo's default branch:
   `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`

3. If `gh` is unavailable or both commands fail, infer from local refs:
   - Prefer `origin/HEAD`
   - Then prefer an existing local branch in this order: `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop`
   - If none exist, use the current branch as a best-effort fallback and say so explicitly

4. Set `BASE_BRANCH` and `BASE_REF` to the chosen values and echo them before continuing:

```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's#^refs/remotes/origin/##')
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && for _CANDIDATE in main master trunk develop; do git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$_CANDIDATE" && BASE_BRANCH="$_CANDIDATE" && break; done
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
BASE_REF="$BASE_BRANCH"
[ -n "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$BASE_BRANCH" && BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
echo "BASE_BRANCH: $BASE_BRANCH"
echo "BASE_REF: $BASE_REF"
```

# Ship: Fully Automated Ship Workflow

You are running the `/ship` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated** workflow. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/ship` which means DO IT. Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the base branch (abort)
- Merge conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (stop, show conflicts)
- Test failures (stop, show failures)
- Pre-landing review finds ASK items that need user judgment
- MINOR or MAJOR version bump needed (ask — see Step 4)
- Greptile review comments that need user decision (complex fixes, false positives)
- TODOS.md missing and user wants to create one (ask — see Step 5.5)
- TODOS.md disorganized and user wants to reorganize (ask — see Step 5.5)

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Version bump choice (auto-pick MICRO or PATCH — see Step 4)
- CHANGELOG content (auto-generate from diff)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- Multi-file changesets (auto-split into bisectable commits)
- TODOS.md completed-item detection (auto-mark)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)
- Test coverage gaps (auto-generate and commit, or flag in PR body)

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch or the repo's default branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD --stat` and `git log "$BASE_REF"..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

4. Check review readiness:

## Review Readiness Dashboard

Build the dashboard from the local analytics log instead of `gstack-review-read`.

Use `$_REVIEW_LOG` as the source of truth. Find the most recent entry for each skill
(`plan-ceo-review`, `plan-eng-review`, `plan-design-review`, `design-review-lite`,
`codex-review`) for this repo and branch. Ignore entries older than 7 days. For Design
Review, show whichever is more recent between `plan-design-review` (full visual audit)
and `design-review-lite` (code-level check). Append `(FULL)` or `(LITE)` to the status
to distinguish.

Minimum parsing fields:
- `skill`
- `ts`
- `status`
- `commit` if present
- `repo` if present
- `branch` if present

If the log is missing, unreadable, or empty, treat all reviews as absent rather than failing `/ship`.

```
+====================================================================+
|                    REVIEW READINESS DASHBOARD                       |
+====================================================================+
| Review          | Runs | Last Run            | Status    | Required |
|-----------------|------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| Eng Review      |  1   | 2026-03-16 15:00    | CLEAR     | YES      |
| CEO Review      |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
| Design Review   |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
| Codex Review    |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VERDICT: CLEARED — Eng Review passed                                |
+====================================================================+
```

**Review tiers:**
- **Eng Review (required by default):** The only review that gates shipping. Covers architecture, code quality, tests, performance.
- **CEO Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for big product/business changes, new user-facing features, or scope decisions. Skip for bug fixes, refactors, infra, and cleanup.
- **Design Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for UI/UX changes. Skip for backend-only, infra, or prompt-only changes.
- **Codex Review (optional):** Independent review + adversarial challenge from OpenAI Codex. If a prior `codex-review` entry exists in the analytics log, show it. Otherwise show it as not run.

**Verdict logic:**
- **CLEARED**: Eng Review has >= 1 entry within 7 days with status `clean`
- **NOT CLEARED**: Eng Review missing, stale (>7 days), or has open issues
- CEO, Design, and Codex reviews are shown for context but never block shipping

**Staleness detection:** After displaying the dashboard, check if any existing reviews may be stale:
- Use `git rev-parse HEAD` to get the current HEAD commit hash
- For each review entry that has a \`commit\` field: compare it against the current HEAD. If different, count elapsed commits: \`git rev-list --count STORED_COMMIT..HEAD\`. Display: "Note: {skill} review from {date} may be stale — {N} commits since review"
- For entries without a \`commit\` field (legacy entries): display "Note: {skill} review from {date} has no commit tracking — consider re-running for accurate staleness detection"
- If all reviews match the current HEAD, do not display any staleness notes

If the Eng Review is NOT "CLEAR":

1. **Check for a prior override on this branch:**
   ```bash
   OVERRIDE_LOG="$_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR/${_BRANCH_SAFE}-ship-overrides.jsonl"
   [ -f "$OVERRIDE_LOG" ] && grep '"skill":"ship-review-override"' "$OVERRIDE_LOG" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_OVERRIDE"
   ```
   If an override exists, display the dashboard and note "Review gate previously accepted — continuing." Do NOT ask again.

2. **If no override exists,** ask directly in chat using the Conversational Decision Protocol:
   - Show that Eng Review is missing or has open issues
   - RECOMMENDATION: Choose C if the change is obviously trivial (< 20 lines, typo fix, config-only); Choose B for larger changes
   - Options: A) Ship anyway  B) Abort — run /plan-eng-review first  C) Change is too small to need eng review
   - If CEO Review is missing, mention as informational ("CEO Review not run — recommended for product changes") but do NOT block
   - For Design Review: inspect the diff against `"$BASE_REF"` and treat files matching common frontend patterns (`app/**/*.tsx`, `app/**/*.jsx`, `app/**/*.css`, `app/**/*.scss`, `components/**/*`, `pages/**/*`, `src/**/*.tsx`, `src/**/*.jsx`, `src/**/*.css`, `public/**/*`) as frontend scope. If frontend scope is present and no design review exists in the dashboard, mention: "Design Review not run — this PR changes frontend code. The lite design check will run automatically in Step 3.5, but consider running /design-review for a full visual audit post-implementation." Still never block.

3. **If the user chooses A or C,** persist the decision so future `/ship` runs on this branch skip the gate:
   ```bash
   OVERRIDE_LOG="$_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR/${_BRANCH_SAFE}-ship-overrides.jsonl"
   mkdir -p "$_GLOBAL_REVIEW_DIR"
   echo '{"skill":"ship-review-override","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","repo":"'"$_REPO"'","branch":"'"$_BRANCH"'","decision":"USER_CHOICE"}' >> "$OVERRIDE_LOG"
   ```
   Substitute USER_CHOICE with "ship_anyway" or "not_relevant".

---

## Step 2: Merge the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Fetch and merge the base branch into the feature branch so tests run against the merged state:

```bash
if git remote get-url origin >/dev/null 2>&1 && git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$BASE_BRANCH"; then
  git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH" && git merge "origin/$BASE_BRANCH" --no-edit
else
  git merge "$BASE_REF" --no-edit
fi
```

**If there are merge conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve if they are simple (VERSION, schema.rb, CHANGELOG ordering). If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, **STOP** and show them.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

If neither `origin/$BASE_BRANCH` nor a mergeable local `BASE_REF` exists, stop and report that the base branch could not be resolved safely for shipping.

---

## Step 2.5: Test Framework Bootstrap

## Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Ask directly in chat:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → first run `mkdir -p .codex/gstack`, then write `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Ask directly in chat using the Conversational Decision Protocol:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → first run `mkdir -p .codex/gstack`, then write `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → restore only bootstrap-touched manifest/config files if it is safe to do so, warn user, and continue without tests. Never discard unrelated user edits.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → restore only bootstrap-touched files if it is safe to do so, warn user, and continue without tests. Never discard unrelated user edits.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

---

## Step 3: Run tests (on merged code)

Resolve the actual test commands from the repo before running anything.

- If `bin/test-lane` exists and is executable, include it as one test command.
- If `package.json` exists and has a `test` script, include `npm run test`.
- If the bootstrap step selected or verified another command, use that verified command instead.
- If multiple suites exist, run them in parallel when they do not contend for the same shared resources. If they do contend, run them sequentially.
- If no test command can be determined, stop and report that verification cannot continue safely.

Project-specific note:
- Do **not** run `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate` if the project uses `bin/test-lane`; `bin/test-lane` already prepares the correct lane database.

Example execution pattern:

```bash
PRIMARY_TEST_CMD="..."
SECONDARY_TEST_CMD="..."
```

Run each resolved command, capture output, and check pass/fail.

**If any test fails:** Show the failures and **STOP**. Do not proceed.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — just note the counts briefly.

---

## Step 3.25: Eval Suites (conditional)

Evals are mandatory when prompt-related files change. Skip this step entirely if no prompt files are in the diff.

**1. Check if the diff touches prompt-related files:**

```bash
git diff "$BASE_REF" --name-only
```

Match against these patterns (from CLAUDE.md):
- `app/services/*_prompt_builder.rb`
- `app/services/*_generation_service.rb`, `*_writer_service.rb`, `*_designer_service.rb`
- `app/services/*_evaluator.rb`, `*_scorer.rb`, `*_classifier_service.rb`, `*_analyzer.rb`
- `app/services/concerns/*voice*.rb`, `*writing*.rb`, `*prompt*.rb`, `*token*.rb`
- `app/services/chat_tools/*.rb`, `app/services/x_thread_tools/*.rb`
- `config/system_prompts/*.txt`
- `test/evals/**/*` (eval infrastructure changes affect all suites)

**If no matches:** Print "No prompt-related files changed — skipping evals." and continue to Step 3.5.

**2. Identify affected eval suites:**

Each eval runner (`test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb`) declares `PROMPT_SOURCE_FILES` listing which source files affect it. Grep these to find which suites match the changed files:

```bash
grep -l "changed_file_basename" test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb
```

Map runner → test file: `post_generation_eval_runner.rb` → `post_generation_eval_test.rb`.

**Special cases:**
- Changes to `test/evals/judges/*.rb`, `test/evals/support/*.rb`, or `test/evals/fixtures/` affect ALL suites that use those judges/support files. Check imports in the eval test files to determine which.
- Changes to `config/system_prompts/*.txt` — grep eval runners for the prompt filename to find affected suites.
- If unsure which suites are affected, run ALL suites that could plausibly be impacted. Over-testing is better than missing a regression.

**3. Run affected suites at `EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full`:**

`/ship` is a pre-merge gate, so always use full tier (Sonnet structural + Opus persona judges).

Resolve the actual eval command before running:
- If the repo already documents an eval command, use that.
- If `bin/test-lane` exists and the project uses it for evals, use `bin/test-lane --eval ...`.
- If prompt-related files changed but no runnable eval command can be determined, stop and report that the mandatory eval gate could not be executed safely.

Example:

```bash
EVAL_CMD="..."
EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full EVAL_VERBOSE=1 $EVAL_CMD test/evals/<suite>_eval_test.rb 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ship_evals.txt
```

If multiple suites need to run, run them sequentially (each needs a test lane). If the first suite fails, stop immediately — don't burn API cost on remaining suites.

**4. Check results:**

- **If any eval fails:** Show the failures, the cost dashboard, and **STOP**. Do not proceed.
- **If all pass:** Note pass counts and cost. Continue to Step 3.5.

**5. Save eval output** — include eval results and cost dashboard in the PR body (Step 8).

**Tier reference (for context — /ship always uses `full`):**
| Tier | When | Speed (cached) | Cost |
|------|------|----------------|------|
| `fast` (Haiku) | Dev iteration, smoke tests | ~5s (14x faster) | ~$0.07/run |
| `standard` (Sonnet) | Default dev, project eval command | ~17s (4x faster) | ~$0.37/run |
| `full` (Opus persona) | **`/ship` and pre-merge** | ~72s (baseline) | ~$1.27/run |

---

## Step 3.4: Test Coverage Audit

100% coverage is the goal — every untested path is a path where bugs hide and vibe coding becomes yolo coding. Evaluate what was ACTUALLY coded (from the diff), not what was planned.

**0. Before/after test count:**

```bash
# Count test files before any generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

Store this number for the PR body.

**1. Trace every codepath changed** using `git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD`:

Read every changed file. For each one, trace how data flows through the code — don't just list functions, actually follow the execution:

1. **Read the diff.** For each changed file, read the full file (not just the diff hunk) to understand context.
2. **Trace data flow.** Starting from each entry point (route handler, exported function, event listener, component render), follow the data through every branch:
   - Where does input come from? (request params, props, database, API call)
   - What transforms it? (validation, mapping, computation)
   - Where does it go? (database write, API response, rendered output, side effect)
   - What can go wrong at each step? (null/undefined, invalid input, network failure, empty collection)
3. **Diagram the execution.** For each changed file, draw an ASCII diagram showing:
   - Every function/method that was added or modified
   - Every conditional branch (if/else, switch, ternary, guard clause, early return)
   - Every error path (try/catch, rescue, error boundary, fallback)
   - Every call to another function (trace into it — does IT have untested branches?)
   - Every edge: what happens with null input? Empty array? Invalid type?

This is the critical step — you're building a map of every line of code that can execute differently based on input. Every branch in this diagram needs a test.

**2. Map user flows, interactions, and error states:**

Code coverage isn't enough — you need to cover how real users interact with the changed code. For each changed feature, think through:

- **User flows:** What sequence of actions does a user take that touches this code? Map the full journey (e.g., "user clicks 'Pay' → form validates → API call → success/failure screen"). Each step in the journey needs a test.
- **Interaction edge cases:** What happens when the user does something unexpected?
  - Double-click/rapid resubmit
  - Navigate away mid-operation (back button, close tab, click another link)
  - Submit with stale data (page sat open for 30 minutes, session expired)
  - Slow connection (API takes 10 seconds — what does the user see?)
  - Concurrent actions (two tabs, same form)
- **Error states the user can see:** For every error the code handles, what does the user actually experience?
  - Is there a clear error message or a silent failure?
  - Can the user recover (retry, go back, fix input) or are they stuck?
  - What happens with no network? With a 500 from the API? With invalid data from the server?
- **Empty/zero/boundary states:** What does the UI show with zero results? With 10,000 results? With a single character input? With maximum-length input?

Add these to your diagram alongside the code branches. A user flow with no test is just as much a gap as an untested if/else.

**3. Check each branch against existing tests:**

Go through your diagram branch by branch — both code paths AND user flows. For each one, search for a test that exercises it:
- Function `processPayment()` → look for `billing.test.ts`, `billing.spec.ts`, `test/billing_test.rb`
- An if/else → look for tests covering BOTH the true AND false path
- An error handler → look for a test that triggers that specific error condition
- A call to `helperFn()` that has its own branches → those branches need tests too
- A user flow → look for an integration or E2E test that walks through the journey
- An interaction edge case → look for a test that simulates the unexpected action

Quality scoring rubric:
- ★★★  Tests behavior with edge cases AND error paths
- ★★   Tests correct behavior, happy path only
- ★    Smoke test / existence check / trivial assertion (e.g., "it renders", "it doesn't throw")

**4. Output ASCII coverage diagram:**

Include BOTH code paths and user flows in the same diagram:

```

```

**Fast path:** All paths covered → "Step 3.4: All new code paths have test coverage ✓" Continue.

**5. Generate tests for uncovered paths:**

If test framework detected (or bootstrapped in Step 2.5):
- Prioritize error handlers and edge cases first (happy paths are more likely already tested)
- Read 2-3 existing test files to match conventions exactly
- Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis).
- Write tests that exercise the specific uncovered path with real assertions
- Run each test. Passes → commit as `test: coverage for {feature}`
- Fails → fix once. Still fails → revert, note gap in diagram.

Caps: 30 code paths max, 20 tests generated max (code + user flow combined), 2-min per-test exploration cap.

If no test framework AND user declined bootstrap → diagram only, no generation. Note: "Test generation skipped — no test framework configured."

**Diff is test-only changes:** Skip Step 3.4 entirely: "No new application code paths to audit."

**6. After-count and coverage summary:**

```bash
# Count test files after generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

For PR body: `Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)`
Coverage line: `Test Coverage Audit: N new code paths. M covered (X%). K tests generated, J committed.`

---

## Step 3.5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

1. Read `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/checklist.md`. If the file cannot be read, **STOP** and report the error.

2. Run `git diff "$BASE_REF"` to get the full diff (scoped to feature changes against the freshly-fetched base branch).

3. Apply the review checklist in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** All remaining categories

## Design Review (conditional, diff-scoped)

Check if the diff touches frontend files by inspecting changed paths against common frontend patterns.

Examples of frontend scope:
- `app/**/*.tsx`, `app/**/*.jsx`, `app/**/*.css`, `app/**/*.scss`
- `src/**/*.tsx`, `src/**/*.jsx`, `src/**/*.css`, `src/**/*.scss`
- `components/**/*`
- `pages/**/*`
- `public/**/*`
- template/view files such as `*.erb`, `*.haml`, `*.slim`, `*.html`

If none of the changed files match these patterns, treat `SCOPE_FRONTEND=false` and skip design review silently.

If any changed files match, treat `SCOPE_FRONTEND=true` and continue.

1. **Check for DESIGN.md.** If `DESIGN.md` or `design-system.md` exists in the repo root, read it. All design findings are calibrated against it — patterns blessed in DESIGN.md are not flagged. If not found, use universal design principles.

2. **Read `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/design-checklist.md`.** If the file cannot be read, skip design review with a note: "Design checklist not found — skipping design review."

3. **Read each changed frontend file** (full file, not just diff hunks). Frontend files are identified by the patterns listed in the checklist.

4. **Apply the design checklist** against the changed files. For each item:
   - **[HIGH] mechanical CSS fix** (`outline: none`, `!important`, `font-size < 16px`): classify as AUTO-FIX
   - **[HIGH/MEDIUM] design judgment needed**: classify as ASK
   - **[LOW] intent-based detection**: present as "Possible — verify visually or run /design-review"

5. **Include findings** in the review output under a "Design Review" header, following the output format in the checklist. Design findings merge with code review findings into the same Fix-First flow.

6. **Log the result** for the Review Readiness Dashboard:

Append a JSONL entry to `$_REVIEW_LOG`:

```bash
echo '{"skill":"design-review-lite","repo":"'"$_REPO"'","branch":"'"$_BRANCH"'","ts":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","findings":N,"auto_fixed":M,"commit":"COMMIT"}' >> "$_REVIEW_LOG"
```

Substitute: TIMESTAMP = ISO 8601 datetime, STATUS = `clean` if 0 findings or `issues_found`, N = total findings, M = auto-fixed count, COMMIT = output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.

   Include any design findings alongside the code review findings. They follow the same Fix-First flow below.

4. **Classify each finding as AUTO-FIX or ASK** per the Fix-First Heuristic in
   checklist.md. Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational lean toward AUTO-FIX.

5. **Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items.** Apply each fix. Output one line per fix:
   `[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

6. **If ASK items remain,** present them in one direct chat decision gate using the Conversational Decision Protocol:
   - List each with number, severity, problem, recommended fix
   - Per-item options: A) Fix  B) Skip
   - Overall RECOMMENDATION
   - If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual direct chat decision gates instead

7. **After all fixes (auto + user-approved):**
   - If ANY fixes were applied: commit fixed files by name (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: pre-landing review fixes"`), then **STOP** and tell the user to run `/ship` again to re-test.
   - If no fixes applied (all ASK items skipped, or no issues found): continue to Step 4.

8. Output summary: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues — M auto-fixed, K asked (J fixed, L skipped)`

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

Save the review output — it goes into the PR body in Step 8.

---

## Step 3.75: Address Greptile review comments (if PR exists)

Read `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/greptile-triage.md` and follow the fetch, filter, classify, and **escalation detection** steps.

**If no PR exists, `gh` fails, API returns an error, or there are zero Greptile comments:** Skip this step silently. Continue to Step 4.

**If Greptile comments are found:**

Include a Greptile summary in your output: `+ N Greptile comments (X valid, Y fixed, Z FP)`

Before replying to any comment, run the **Escalation Detection** algorithm from greptile-triage.md to determine whether to use Tier 1 (friendly) or Tier 2 (firm) reply templates.

For each classified comment:

**VALID & ACTIONABLE:** Ask directly in chat with:
- The comment (file:line or [top-level] + body summary + permalink URL)
- `RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [one-line reason]`
- Options: A) Fix now, B) Acknowledge and ship anyway, C) It's a false positive
- If user chooses A: apply the fix, commit the fixed files (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: address Greptile review — <brief description>"`), reply using the **Fix reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include inline diff + explanation), and save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fix).
- If user chooses C: reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fp).

**VALID BUT ALREADY FIXED:** Reply using the **Already Fixed reply template** from greptile-triage.md — no decision gate needed:
- Include what was done and the fixing commit SHA
- Save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: already-fixed)

**FALSE POSITIVE:** Ask directly in chat:
- Show the comment and why you think it's wrong (file:line or [top-level] + body summary + permalink URL)
- Options:
  - A) Reply to Greptile explaining the false positive (recommended if clearly wrong)
  - B) Fix it anyway (if trivial)
  - C) Ignore silently
- If user chooses A: reply using the **False Positive reply template** from greptile-triage.md (include evidence + suggested re-rank), save to both per-project and global greptile-history (type: fp)

**SUPPRESSED:** Skip silently — these are known false positives from previous triage.

**After all comments are resolved:** If any fixes were applied, the tests from Step 3 are now stale. **Re-run tests** (Step 3) before continuing to Step 4. If no fixes were applied, continue to Step 4.

---



## Step 4: Version bump (auto-decide)

1. Read the current `VERSION` file (4-digit format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO`)

2. **Auto-decide the bump level based on the diff:**
   - Count lines changed (`git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD --stat | tail -1`)
   - **MICRO** (4th digit): < 50 lines changed, trivial tweaks, typos, config
   - **PATCH** (3rd digit): 50+ lines changed, bug fixes, small-medium features
   - **MINOR** (2nd digit): **ASK the user** — only for major features or significant architectural changes
   - **MAJOR** (1st digit): **ASK the user** — only for milestones or breaking changes

3. Compute the new version:
   - Bumping a digit resets all digits to its right to 0
   - Example: `0.19.1.0` + PATCH → `0.19.2.0`

4. Write the new version to the `VERSION` file.

---

## Step 5: CHANGELOG (auto-generate)

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` header to know the format.

2. Auto-generate the entry from **ALL commits on the branch** (not just recent ones):
   - Use `git log "$BASE_REF"..HEAD --oneline` to see every commit being shipped
   - Use `git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD` to see the full diff against the base branch
   - The CHANGELOG entry must be comprehensive of ALL changes going into the PR
   - If existing CHANGELOG entries on the branch already cover some commits, replace them with one unified entry for the new version
   - Categorize changes into applicable sections:
     - `### Added` — new features
     - `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality
     - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
     - `### Removed` — removed features
   - Write concise, descriptive bullet points
   - Insert after the file header (line 5), dated today
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z.W] - YYYY-MM-DD`

**Do NOT ask the user to describe changes.** Infer from the diff and commit history.

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS.md (auto-update)

Cross-reference the project's TODOS.md against the changes being shipped. Mark completed items automatically; prompt only if the file is missing or disorganized.

Read `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/TODOS-format.md` for the canonical format reference.

**1. Check if TODOS.md exists** in the repository root.

**If TODOS.md does not exist:** Ask directly in chat:
- Message: "GStack recommends maintaining a TODOS.md organized by skill/component, then priority (P0 at top through P4, then Completed at bottom). See `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/TODOS-format.md` for the full format. Would you like to create one?"
- Options: A) Create it now, B) Skip for now
- If A: Create `TODOS.md` with a skeleton (# TODOS heading + ## Completed section). Continue to step 3.
- If B: Skip the rest of Step 5.5. Continue to Step 6.

**2. Check structure and organization:**

Read TODOS.md and verify it follows the recommended structure:
- Items grouped under `## <Skill/Component>` headings
- Each item has `**Priority:**` field with P0-P4 value
- A `## Completed` section at the bottom

**If disorganized** (missing priority fields, no component groupings, no Completed section): Ask directly in chat:
- Message: "TODOS.md doesn't follow the recommended structure (skill/component groupings, P0-P4 priority, Completed section). Would you like to reorganize it?"
- Options: A) Reorganize now (recommended), B) Leave as-is
- If A: Reorganize in-place following `$_SUPPORT_REVIEW_DIR/TODOS-format.md`. Preserve all content — only restructure, never delete items.
- If B: Continue to step 3 without restructuring.

**3. Detect completed TODOs:**

This step is fully automatic — no user interaction.

Use the diff and commit history already gathered in earlier steps:
- `git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD` (full diff against the base branch)
- `git log "$BASE_REF"..HEAD --oneline` (all commits being shipped)

For each TODO item, check if the changes in this PR complete it by:
- Matching commit messages against the TODO title and description
- Checking if files referenced in the TODO appear in the diff
- Checking if the TODO's described work matches the functional changes

**Be conservative:** Only mark a TODO as completed if there is clear evidence in the diff. If uncertain, leave it alone.

**4. Move completed items** to the `## Completed` section at the bottom. Append: `**Completed:** vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`

**5. Output summary:**
- `TODOS.md: N items marked complete (item1, item2, ...). M items remaining.`
- Or: `TODOS.md: No completed items detected. M items remaining.`
- Or: `TODOS.md: Created.` / `TODOS.md: Reorganized.`

**6. Defensive:** If TODOS.md cannot be written (permission error, disk full), warn the user and continue. Never stop the ship workflow for a TODOS failure.

Save this summary — it goes into the PR body in Step 8.

---

## Step 6: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect` and help LLMs understand what changed.

1. Analyze the diff and group changes into logical commits. Each commit should represent **one coherent change** — not one file, but one logical unit.

2. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** migrations, config changes, route additions
   - **Models & services:** new models, services, concerns (with their tests)
   - **Controllers & views:** controllers, views, JS/React components (with their tests)
   - **VERSION + CHANGELOG + TODOS.md:** always in the final commit

3. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A model and its test file go in the same commit
   - A service and its test file go in the same commit
   - A controller, its views, and its test go in the same commit
   - Migrations are their own commit (or grouped with the model they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

4. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

5. Compose each commit message:
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Body: brief description of what this commit contains
   - Only the **final commit** (VERSION + CHANGELOG) gets the version tag and co-author trailer:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: bump version and changelog (vX.Y.Z.W)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

---

## Step 6.5: Verification Gate

**IRON LAW: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.**

Before pushing, re-verify if code changed during Steps 4-6:

1. **Test verification:** If ANY code changed after Step 3's test run (fixes from review findings, CHANGELOG edits don't count), re-run the test suite. Paste fresh output. Stale output from Step 3 is NOT acceptable.

2. **Build verification:** If the project has a build step, run it. Paste output.

3. **Rationalization prevention:**
   - "Should work now" → RUN IT.
   - "I'm confident" → Confidence is not evidence.
   - "I already tested earlier" → Code changed since then. Test again.
   - "It's a trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

**If tests fail here:** STOP. Do not push. Fix the issue and return to Step 3.

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

---

## Step 7: Push

Push to the remote with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin "$_BRANCH"
```

---

## Step 8: Create PR

Create a pull request using `gh`:

- If `gh` is unavailable, not authenticated, or the repo host does not support PR creation via `gh`, stop and report that pushing completed but PR creation is blocked.
- Only continue to Step 8.5 after the PR is created successfully and you have the PR URL.

```bash
gh pr create --base "$BASE_BRANCH" --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

```

**Output the PR URL** — then proceed to Step 8.5.

---

## Step 8.5: Auto-invoke /document-release

After the PR is created, automatically sync project documentation. Read the
`document-release/SKILL.md` skill file (adjacent to this skill's directory) and
execute its full workflow:

1. Read the `/document-release` skill at `$_CODEX_GSTACK_WORKTREE/gstack-document-release/SKILL.md`. If the skill file cannot be read, stop and report that doc sync could not be auto-invoked.
2. Follow its instructions — it reads all .md files in the project, cross-references
   the diff, and updates anything that drifted (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING,
   CLAUDE.md, TODOS, etc.)
3. If any docs were updated, commit the changes and push to the same branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with shipped changes" && git push
   ```
4. If no docs needed updating, say "Documentation is current — no updates needed."

This step is automatic. Do not ask the user for confirmation. The goal is zero-friction
doc updates — the user runs `/ship` and documentation stays current without a separate command.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never skip tests.** If tests fail, stop.
- **Never skip the pre-landing review.** If checklist.md is unreadable, stop.
- **Never force push.** Use regular `git push` only.
- **Never ask for trivial confirmations** (e.g., "ready to push?", "create PR?"). DO stop for: version bumps (MINOR/MAJOR), pre-landing review findings (ASK items), and critical review findings that require user judgment.
- **Always use the 4-digit version format** from the VERSION file.
- **Date format in CHANGELOG:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Split commits for bisectability** — each commit = one logical change.
- **TODOS.md completion detection must be conservative.** Only mark items as completed when the diff clearly shows the work is done.
- **Use Greptile reply templates from greptile-triage.md.** Every reply includes evidence (inline diff, code references, re-rank suggestion). Never post vague replies.
- **Never push without fresh verification evidence.** If code changed after Step 3 tests, re-run before pushing.
- **Step 3.4 generates coverage tests.** They must pass before committing. Never commit failing tests.
- **The goal is: user says `/ship`, next thing they see is the review + PR URL + auto-synced docs.**
