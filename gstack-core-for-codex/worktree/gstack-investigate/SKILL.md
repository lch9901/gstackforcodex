  Systematic debugging with root cause investigation. Four phases: investigate,
  analyze, hypothesize, implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause.
  Use when asked to "debug this", "fix this bug", "why is this broken",
  "investigate this error", or "root cause analysis".
  Proactively suggest when the user reports errors, unexpected behavior, or
  is troubleshooting why something stopped working.

## Codex Compatibility

This version preserves the gstack workflow while removing Claude-specific product shell,
telemetry prompts, contributor flows, upgrade flows, and host-only interaction APIs.

### Conversational Decision Protocol

Whenever the original skill says `AskUserQuestion`, ask directly in the normal chat.

Use this structure:
1. **Re-ground:** Briefly restate the project, current branch, current debug phase, and the decision in front of the user.
2. **Simplify:** Explain the risk or tradeoff in plain English without implementation-heavy jargon.
3. **Recommend:** Give a clear recommendation, including completeness posture when relevant.
4. **Ask one question:** Offer 2-3 concrete options only when there is a meaningful tradeoff.

Rules:
- Ask one focused question at a time.
- Wait for the user's reply before moving to the next decision gate.
- If the answer is obvious and there is no meaningful tradeoff, state what you are doing and continue.
- When effort matters, prefer showing both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort.

### Completeness Principle

AI-assisted development makes the marginal cost of completeness much lower than human-only work.
When presenting options:

- Prefer the complete version when the extra effort is modest.
- Treat root-cause tracing, regression tests, and fresh verification evidence as cheap wins.
- Distinguish **boilable lakes** from **unbounded oceans**. A lake is a bounded bug investigation and repair. An ocean is a speculative rewrite, framework migration, or unrelated cleanup campaign.
- When estimating effort, mention both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort if it helps the user choose.

Anti-patterns:
- Recommending a shortcut only because it is shorter.
- Proposing a symptom fix before tracing the code path.
- Talking only in team-weeks when the practical AI-assisted cost is hours.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Local Workspace Conventions

Re-run this bootstrap block before any phase that relies on repository paths, analytics,
or repo-local debugging notes. Do not assume variables from an earlier step still exist.

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$_ROOT" ] && _ROOT="$PWD"
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
_REPO=$(basename "$_ROOT")
_SLUG=$(printf "%s" "$_REPO" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-')
_BRANCH_SAFE=$(printf "%s" "$_BRANCH" | tr '/:' '--')
_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/projects/$_SLUG"
_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR="$_ROOT/.codex/gstack"
_LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR="$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR/investigations"
_GLOBAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR="$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR/investigations"
_ANALYTICS_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics"
_REVIEW_LOG="$_ANALYTICS_DIR/reviews.jsonl"
mkdir -p "$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR" "$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR" "$_LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR" "$_GLOBAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR" "$_ANALYTICS_DIR"
echo "ROOT: $_ROOT"
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR: $_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR"
echo "LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR: $_LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR"
echo "GLOBAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR: $_GLOBAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR"
echo "REVIEW_LOG: $_REVIEW_LOG"
```

Registry policy:
- `$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR` is the source of truth for cross-session gstack history.
- `$_LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR` stores repo-local debug notes if this workflow writes any.
- `$_GLOBAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR` stores canonical investigation summaries for cross-session context.

## Analytics (run last when practical)

If the workflow completes and you can safely write local analytics without relying on
missing gstack binaries, append lightweight JSONL records under
`$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics/`. If you cannot determine a field, omit it instead of
failing the workflow.

# Systematic Debugging

## Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Fixing symptoms creates whack-a-mole debugging. Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. Find the root cause, then fix it.

---

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

Gather context before forming any hypothesis.

1. **Collect symptoms:** Read the error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps. If the user hasn't provided enough context, ask one focused question at a time via the Conversational Decision Protocol.

2. **Read the code:** Trace the code path from the symptom back to potential causes. Use Grep to find all references, Read to understand the logic.

3. **Check recent changes:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>
   ```
   Was this working before? What changed? A regression means the root cause is in the diff.

4. **Reproduce:** Can you trigger the bug deterministically? If not, gather more evidence before proceeding.

Output: **"Root cause hypothesis: ..."** — a specific, testable claim about what is wrong and why.

---

## Scope Lock

After forming your root cause hypothesis, declare the narrowest expected edit boundary to prevent scope creep.

Use this lightweight Codex-compatible scope lock:

```bash
SCOPE_LOCK_FILE="$_LOCAL_INVESTIGATE_DIR/${_BRANCH_SAFE}-scope-lock.txt"
echo "<detected-directory-or-file-pattern>" > "$SCOPE_LOCK_FILE"
echo "Debug scope lock recorded in: $SCOPE_LOCK_FILE"
```

Substitute `<detected-directory-or-file-pattern>` with the actual boundary (for example `src/auth/` or `app/services/billing*`).

Behavior rules:
- Treat the scope lock as advisory but strict-by-default.
- Before editing a file outside the recorded boundary, pause and explain why the root cause now appears broader than expected.
- If the bug genuinely spans the whole repo or the scope is unclear, skip the lock and note why instead of pretending you have a narrow boundary.

---

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

Check if this bug matches a known pattern:

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Concurrent access to shared state |
| Nil/null propagation | NoMethodError, TypeError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | External API calls, service boundaries |
| Configuration drift | Works locally, fails in staging/prod | Env vars, feature flags, DB state |
| Stale cache | Shows old data, fixes on cache clear | Redis, CDN, browser cache, Turbo |

Also check:
- `TODOS.md` for related known issues
- `git log` for prior fixes in the same area — **recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell**, not a coincidence

---

## Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing

Before writing ANY fix, verify your hypothesis.

1. **Confirm the hypothesis:** Add a temporary log statement, assertion, or debug output at the suspected root cause. Run the reproduction. Does the evidence match?

2. **If the hypothesis is wrong:** Return to Phase 1. Gather more evidence. Do not guess.

3. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, **STOP**. Ask directly in chat using the Conversational Decision Protocol:
   ```
   3 hypotheses tested, none match. This may be an architectural issue
   rather than a simple bug.

   A) Continue investigating — I have a new hypothesis: [describe]
   B) Escalate for human review — this needs someone who knows the system
   C) Add logging and wait — instrument the area and catch it next time
   ```

**Red flags** — if you see any of these, slow down:
- "Quick fix for now" — there is no "for now." Fix it right or escalate.
- Proposing a fix before tracing data flow — you're guessing.
- Each fix reveals a new problem elsewhere — wrong layer, not wrong code.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Once root cause is confirmed:

1. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** The smallest change that eliminates the actual problem.

2. **Minimal diff:** Fewest files touched, fewest lines changed. Resist the urge to refactor adjacent code.

3. **Write a regression test** that:
   - **Fails** without the fix (proves the test is meaningful)
   - **Passes** with the fix (proves the fix works)

4. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions allowed.

5. **If the fix touches >5 files:** Ask directly in chat to flag the blast radius:
   ```
   This fix touches N files. That's a large blast radius for a bug fix.
   A) Proceed — the root cause genuinely spans these files
   B) Split — fix the critical path now, defer the rest
   C) Rethink — maybe there's a more targeted approach
   ```

---

## Phase 5: Verification & Report

**Fresh verification:** Reproduce the original bug scenario and confirm it's fixed. This is not optional.

Run the test suite and paste the output.

Output a structured debug report:
```
DEBUG REPORT
════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom:         [what the user observed]
Root cause:      [what was actually wrong]
Fix:             [what was changed, with file:line references]
Evidence:        [test output, reproduction attempt showing fix works]
Regression test: [file:line of the new test]
Related:         [TODOS.md items, prior bugs in same area, architectural notes]
Status:          DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## Important Rules

- **3+ failed fix attempts → STOP and question the architecture.** Wrong architecture, not failed hypothesis.
- **Never apply a fix you cannot verify.** If you can't reproduce and confirm, don't ship it.
- **Never say "this should fix it."** Verify and prove it. Run the tests.
- **If fix touches >5 files → use a direct chat decision gate** about blast radius before proceeding.
- **Completion status:**
  - DONE — root cause found, fix applied, regression test written, all tests pass
  - DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — fixed but cannot fully verify (e.g., intermittent bug, requires staging)
  - BLOCKED — root cause unclear after investigation, escalated
