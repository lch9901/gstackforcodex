name: qa
description: |
  Systematically QA test a web application and fix bugs found. Runs QA testing,
  then iteratively fixes bugs in source code, committing each fix atomically and
  re-verifying. Use when asked to "qa", "QA", "test this site", "find bugs",
  "test and fix", or "fix what's broken".
  Proactively suggest when the user says a feature is ready for testing
  or asks "does this work?". Three tiers: Quick (critical/high only),
  Standard (+ medium), Exhaustive (+ cosmetic). Produces before/after health scores,
  fix evidence, and a ship-readiness summary. For report-only mode, use /qa-only.

## Codex Compatibility

This version preserves the gstack workflow while removing Claude-specific product shell,
telemetry prompts, contributor flows, upgrade flows, and host-only interaction APIs.

### Conversational Decision Protocol

Whenever the original skill says `AskUserQuestion`, ask directly in the normal chat.

Use this structure:
1. **Re-ground:** Briefly restate the project, current branch, current QA/fix phase, and the decision in front of the user.
2. **Simplify:** Explain the risk or tradeoff in plain English without implementation-heavy jargon.
3. **Recommend:** Give a clear recommendation, including completeness posture when relevant.
4. **Ask one question:** Offer 2-3 concrete options only when there is a meaningful tradeoff.

Rules:
- Ask one focused question at a time.
- Wait for the user's reply before moving to the next decision gate.
- If the answer is obvious and there is no meaningful tradeoff, state what you are doing and continue.
- When effort matters, prefer showing both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort.

### Completeness Principle

AI-assisted development makes the marginal cost of completeness much lower than human-only work.
When presenting options:

- Prefer the complete version when the extra effort is modest.
- Treat end-to-end re-verification, regression tests for real logic bugs, and richer evidence as cheap wins.
- Distinguish **boilable lakes** from **unbounded oceans**. A lake is a complete QA-fix cycle for a bounded app surface. An ocean is endless exploratory testing or unrelated cleanup beyond the bugs found.
- When estimating effort, mention both human-team effort and AI-assisted effort if it helps the user choose.

Anti-patterns:
- Recommending a shortcut only because it is shorter.
- Skipping regression-safe validation on a verified bug fix without a real reason.
- Talking only in team-weeks when the practical AI-assisted cost is hours.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Local Workspace Conventions

Re-run this bootstrap block before any phase that relies on repository paths, QA reports,
test-plan history, test bootstrap state, or analytics. Do not assume variables from an earlier
step still exist.

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$_ROOT" ] && _ROOT="$PWD"
_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
_REPO=$(basename "$_ROOT")
_SLUG=$(printf "%s" "$_REPO" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-')
_BRANCH_SAFE=$(printf "%s" "$_BRANCH" | tr '/:' '--')
_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/projects/$_SLUG"
_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR="$_ROOT/.codex/gstack"
_LOCAL_QA_DIR="$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR/qa-reports"
_LOCAL_SCREENSHOT_DIR="$_LOCAL_QA_DIR/screenshots"
_GLOBAL_QA_DIR="$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR/qa-reports"
_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR="$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR/test-plans"
_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR="$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR/test-plans"
_ANALYTICS_DIR="$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics"
_REVIEW_LOG="$_ANALYTICS_DIR/reviews.jsonl"
_SUPPORT_DIR="/Users/clawtester/Documents/teamagents/vendor/gstack/qa"
mkdir -p "$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR" "$_LOCAL_GSTACK_DIR" "$_LOCAL_QA_DIR" "$_LOCAL_SCREENSHOT_DIR" "$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR" "$_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR" "$_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR" "$_ANALYTICS_DIR"
echo "ROOT: $_ROOT"
echo "BRANCH: $_BRANCH"
echo "GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR: $_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR"
echo "LOCAL_QA_DIR: $_LOCAL_QA_DIR"
echo "GLOBAL_QA_DIR: $_GLOBAL_QA_DIR"
echo "GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR: $_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR"
echo "LOCAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR: $_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR"
echo "SUPPORT_DIR: $_SUPPORT_DIR"
echo "REVIEW_LOG: $_REVIEW_LOG"
```

Registry policy:
- `$_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DIR` is the source of truth for cross-session gstack history.
- `$_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR` is the canonical store for eng-review test plans.
- `$_LOCAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR` mirrors canonical test plans into the repo.
- `$_LOCAL_QA_DIR` stores repo-local QA reports and screenshots.
- `$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR` stores canonical QA reports and baselines.

## Analytics (run last when practical)

If the workflow completes and you can safely write local analytics without relying on
missing gstack binaries, append lightweight JSONL records under
`$HOME/.codex/gstack/analytics/`. If you cannot determine a field, omit it instead of
failing the workflow.

## Step 0: Detect base branch

Determine which branch this QA run should compare against for diff-aware mode.

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch:
   `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`
2. If no PR exists, detect the repo's default branch:
   `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`
3. If `gh` is unavailable or both commands fail, infer from local refs:
   - Prefer `origin/HEAD`
   - Then prefer an existing local branch in this order: `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop`
   - If none exist, use the current branch as a best-effort fallback and note the limitation
4. Set `BASE_BRANCH` and `BASE_REF` and echo them:

```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null || true)
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's#^refs/remotes/origin/##')
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && for _CANDIDATE in main master trunk develop; do git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$_CANDIDATE" && BASE_BRANCH="$_CANDIDATE" && break; done
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "detached")
BASE_REF="$BASE_BRANCH"
[ -n "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$BASE_BRANCH" && BASE_REF="origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
echo "BASE_BRANCH: $BASE_BRANCH"
echo "BASE_REF: $BASE_REF"
```

# /qa: Test → Fix → Verify

You are a QA engineer AND a bug-fix engineer. Test web applications like a real user — click everything, fill every form, check every state. When you find bugs, fix them in source code with atomic commits, then re-verify. Produce a structured report with before/after evidence.

## Setup

**Parse the user's request for these parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Override example |
|-----------|---------|-----------------:|
| Target URL | (auto-detect or required) | `https://myapp.com`, `http://localhost:3000` |
| Tier | Standard | `--quick`, `--exhaustive` |
| Mode | full | `--regression $_ROOT/.codex/gstack/qa-reports/baseline.json` |
| Output dir | `$_ROOT/.codex/gstack/qa-reports/` | `Output to /tmp/qa` |
| Scope | Full app (or diff-scoped) | `Focus on the billing page` |
| Auth | None | `Sign in to user@example.com`, `Import cookies from cookies.json` |

**Tiers determine which issues get fixed:**
- **Quick:** Fix critical + high severity only
- **Standard:** + medium severity (default)
- **Exhaustive:** + low/cosmetic severity

**If no URL is given and you're on a feature branch:** Automatically enter **diff-aware mode** (see Modes below). This is the most common case — the user just shipped code on a branch and wants to verify it works.

**If no URL is given and you're on the base branch:** Ask the user for a URL, then stop and wait for their reply before continuing.

**Check for clean working tree:**

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If the output is non-empty (working tree is dirty), stop and ask directly in chat:

"Your working tree has uncommitted changes. /qa needs a clean tree so each bug fix gets its own atomic commit."

- A) Commit my changes — commit all current changes with a descriptive message, then start QA
- B) Stash my changes — stash, run QA, pop the stash after
- C) Abort — I'll clean up manually

RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because uncommitted work should be preserved as a commit before QA adds its own fix commits.

Ask directly in chat using the Conversational Decision Protocol. Stop and wait for the user's reply before continuing.

After the user chooses, execute their choice (commit or stash), then continue with setup.

**Resolve target URL and artifact names:**

Before Phase 1 begins, make sure `TARGET_URL` is concrete.

- If the user supplied a URL, set `TARGET_URL` to that value immediately.
- If diff-aware mode auto-detects a local or preview app, set `TARGET_URL` to the discovered URL.
- If no URL can be inferred, ask the user for it and stop until they reply.

Once `TARGET_URL` is known, derive the report filenames from it:

```bash
TARGET_DOMAIN=$(printf "%s" "$TARGET_URL" | sed -E 's#^[a-z]+://##' | sed -E 's#/.*$##' | sed -E 's/:[0-9]+$//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
[ -z "$TARGET_DOMAIN" ] && TARGET_DOMAIN="unknown-target"
TARGET_DOMAIN_SLUG=$(printf "%s" "$TARGET_DOMAIN" | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-')
REPORT_DATE=$(date +%F)
REPORT_TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
REPORT_DIR="$_ROOT/.codex/gstack/qa-reports"
REPORT_FILE="$REPORT_DIR/qa-report-${TARGET_DOMAIN_SLUG}-${REPORT_DATE}.md"
GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE="$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR/${_BRANCH_SAFE}-${TARGET_DOMAIN_SLUG}-test-outcome-${REPORT_TIMESTAMP}.md"
LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE="$REPORT_DIR/baseline.json"
GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE="$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR/${_BRANCH_SAFE}-baseline.json"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots" "$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR"
echo "TARGET_URL: $TARGET_URL"
echo "REPORT_FILE: $REPORT_FILE"
echo "GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE: $GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE"
```

**Find the browse binary:**

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.agents/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.agents/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.codex/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user browser automation is unavailable in the current environment.
2. If an equivalent Codex browser or Playwright tool is available, use that instead. For the rest of this skill, treat `$B` as shorthand for that chosen browser automation tool and still produce equivalent screenshots, snapshots, console checks, link maps, and viewport changes.
3. Otherwise stop and tell the user this QA run is blocked until browser automation is available.

**Check test framework (bootstrap if needed):**

## Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Ask directly in chat:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → first run `mkdir -p .codex/gstack`, then write `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Ask directly in chat:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → first run `mkdir -p .codex/gstack`, then write `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.codex/gstack/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing, restore only bootstrap-touched manifest/config files if it is safe to do so, warn user, and continue without tests. Never discard unrelated user edits.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing, restore only bootstrap-touched manifest/config files if it is safe to do so, warn user, and continue without tests. Never discard unrelated user edits.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

**Create output directories (after `TARGET_URL` is known):**

```bash
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots" "$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR"
echo "$REPORT_FILE"
echo "$GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE"
echo "$LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE"
echo "$GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE"
```

---

## Test Plan Context

Before falling back to git diff heuristics, check for richer test plan sources:

1. **Project-scoped test plans:** Check the canonical project test-plan store for recent `*-test-plan-*.md` files for this repo
   ```bash
   find "$_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "${_BRANCH_SAFE}*test-plan*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1
   find "$_GLOBAL_TEST_PLAN_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*test-plan*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1
   ```
2. **Conversation context:** Check if a prior `/plan-eng-review` or `/plan-ceo-review` produced test plan output in this conversation
3. **Use whichever source is richer.** Fall back to git diff analysis only if neither is available.

---

## Phases 1-6: QA Baseline

## Modes

### Diff-aware (automatic when on a feature branch with no URL)

This is the **primary mode** for developers verifying their work. When the user says `/qa` without a URL and the repo is on a feature branch, automatically:

1. **Analyze the branch diff** to understand what changed:
   ```bash
   git diff "$BASE_REF"...HEAD --name-only
   git diff "$BASE_REF" --name-only
   git log "$BASE_REF"..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Identify affected pages/routes** from the changed files:
   - Controller/route files → which URL paths they serve
   - View/template/component files → which pages render them
   - Model/service files → which pages use those models (check controllers that reference them)
   - CSS/style files → which pages include those stylesheets
   - API endpoints → test them directly with `$B js "await fetch('/api/...')"`
   - Static pages (markdown, HTML) → navigate to them directly

   **If no obvious pages/routes are identified from the diff:** Do not skip browser testing. The user invoked /qa because they want browser-based verification. Fall back to Quick mode — navigate to the homepage, follow the top 5 navigation targets, check console for errors, and test any interactive elements found. Backend, config, and infrastructure changes affect app behavior — always verify the app still works.

3. **Detect the running app** — check common local dev ports:
   ```bash
   TARGET_URL=""
   for _CANDIDATE_URL in http://localhost:3000 http://localhost:4000 http://localhost:8080; do
     if $B goto "$_CANDIDATE_URL" 2>/dev/null; then
       TARGET_URL="$_CANDIDATE_URL"
       echo "Found app on $TARGET_URL"
       break
     fi
   done
   ```
   If no local app is found, check for a staging/preview URL in the PR or environment and set `TARGET_URL` to it. If nothing works, ask the user for the URL and stop until they reply. After `TARGET_URL` is set, re-run the artifact-name bootstrap from Setup so `REPORT_FILE` and `GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE` point at the right domain.

4. **Test each affected page/route:**
   - Navigate to the page
   - Take a screenshot
   - Check console for errors
   - If the change was interactive (forms, buttons, flows), test the interaction end-to-end
   - Use `snapshot -D` before and after actions to verify the change had the expected effect

5. **Cross-reference with commit messages and PR description** to understand *intent* — what should the change do? Verify it actually does that.

6. **Check TODOS.md** (if it exists) for known bugs or issues related to the changed files. If a TODO describes a bug that this branch should fix, add it to your test plan. If you find a new bug during QA that isn't in TODOS.md, note it in the report.

7. **Report findings** scoped to the branch changes:
   - "Changes tested: N pages/routes affected by this branch"
   - For each: does it work? Screenshot evidence.
   - Any regressions on adjacent pages?

**If the user provides a URL with diff-aware mode:** Use that URL as the base but still scope testing to the changed files.

### Full (default when URL is provided)
Systematic exploration. Visit every reachable page. Document 5-10 well-evidenced issues. Produce health score. Takes 5-15 minutes depending on app size.

### Quick (`--quick`)
30-second smoke test. Visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets. Check: page loads? Console errors? Broken links? Produce health score. No detailed issue documentation.

### Regression (`--regression <baseline>`)
Run full mode, then load the previous baseline in this order:
1. Explicit baseline path from the user
2. `$GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE`
3. `$LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE`

Resolve that choice into `BASELINE_SOURCE` before comparing:

```bash
BASELINE_SOURCE=""
[ -n "$USER_PROVIDED_BASELINE" ] && [ -f "$USER_PROVIDED_BASELINE" ] && BASELINE_SOURCE="$USER_PROVIDED_BASELINE"
[ -z "$BASELINE_SOURCE" ] && [ -f "$GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE" ] && BASELINE_SOURCE="$GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE"
[ -z "$BASELINE_SOURCE" ] && [ -f "$LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE" ] && BASELINE_SOURCE="$LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE"
echo "BASELINE_SOURCE: $BASELINE_SOURCE"
```

If `BASELINE_SOURCE` is empty, note that regression comparison is unavailable and continue with a fresh baseline-only run. Otherwise diff: which issues are fixed? Which are new? What's the score delta? Append the regression section to the report.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. Find browse binary (see Setup above)
2. Create output directories
3. Copy the report template from `$_SUPPORT_DIR/templates/qa-report-template.md` to `REPORT_FILE`
   If the template cannot be read, stop and report the error.
4. Start timer for duration tracking

### Phase 2: Authenticate (if needed)

**If the user specified auth credentials:**

If login happens on a dedicated auth route, first resolve it into `LOGIN_URL`. If the app authenticates on the main page, set `LOGIN_URL="$TARGET_URL"` and use that.

```bash
LOGIN_URL="${LOGIN_URL:-$TARGET_URL}"
$B goto "$LOGIN_URL"
$B snapshot -i                    # find the login form
$B fill @e3 "user@example.com"
$B fill @e4 "[REDACTED]"         # NEVER include real passwords in report
$B click @e5                      # submit
$B snapshot -D                    # verify login succeeded
```

**If the user provided a cookie file:**

```bash
$B cookie-import cookies.json
$B goto "$TARGET_URL"
```

**If 2FA/OTP is required:** Ask the user for the code and wait.

**If CAPTCHA blocks you:** Tell the user: "Please complete the CAPTCHA in the browser, then tell me to continue."

### Phase 3: Orient

Get a map of the application:

```bash
$B goto "$TARGET_URL"
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/initial.png"
$B links                          # map navigation structure
$B console --errors               # any errors on landing?
```

**Detect framework** (note in report metadata):
- `__next` in HTML or `_next/data` requests → Next.js
- `csrf-token` meta tag → Rails
- `wp-content` in URLs → WordPress
- Client-side routing with no page reloads → SPA

**For SPAs:** The `links` command may return few results because navigation is client-side. Use `snapshot -i` to find nav elements (buttons, menu items) instead.

### Phase 4: Explore

Visit pages systematically. At each page:

Resolve the current route into `PAGE_URL` before each visit.

```bash
$B goto "$PAGE_URL"
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-name.png"
$B console --errors
```

Then follow the **per-page exploration checklist** from `$_SUPPORT_DIR/references/issue-taxonomy.md`.
If the taxonomy file cannot be read, continue with the built-in checklist in this document and note the missing reference in the report metadata.

1. **Visual scan** — Look at the annotated screenshot for layout issues
2. **Interactive elements** — Click buttons, links, controls. Do they work?
3. **Forms** — Fill and submit. Test empty, invalid, edge cases
4. **Navigation** — Check all paths in and out
5. **States** — Empty state, loading, error, overflow
6. **Console** — Any new JS errors after interactions?
7. **Responsiveness** — Check mobile viewport if relevant:
   ```bash
   $B viewport 375x812
   $B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-mobile.png"
   $B viewport 1280x720
   ```

**Depth judgment:** Spend more time on core features (homepage, dashboard, checkout, search) and less on secondary pages (about, terms, privacy).

**Quick mode:** Only visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets from the Orient phase. Skip the per-page checklist — just check: loads? Console errors? Broken links visible?

### Phase 5: Document

Document each issue **immediately when found** — don't batch them.

**Two evidence tiers:**

**Interactive bugs** (broken flows, dead buttons, form failures):
1. Take a screenshot before the action
2. Perform the action
3. Take a screenshot showing the result
4. Use `snapshot -D` to show what changed
5. Write repro steps referencing screenshots

```bash
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-step-1.png"
$B click @e5
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-result.png"
$B snapshot -D
```

**Static bugs** (typos, layout issues, missing images):
1. Take a single annotated screenshot showing the problem
2. Describe what's wrong

```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-002.png"
```

**Write each issue to the report immediately** using the template format from `$_SUPPORT_DIR/templates/qa-report-template.md`.

### Phase 6: Wrap Up

1. **Compute health score** using the rubric below
2. **Write "Top 3 Things to Fix"** — the 3 highest-severity issues
3. **Write console health summary** — aggregate all console errors seen across pages
4. **Update severity counts** in the summary table
5. **Fill in report metadata** — date, duration, pages visited, screenshot count, framework
6. **Save baseline** — write both `$LOCAL_BASELINE_FILE` and `$GLOBAL_BASELINE_FILE` with:
   ```json
     {
       "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
       "url": "$TARGET_URL",
       "healthScore": N,
       "issues": [{ "id": "ISSUE-001", "title": "...", "severity": "...", "category": "..." }],
       "categoryScores": { "console": N, "links": N, ... }
     }
   ```

**Regression mode:** After writing the report, load `BASELINE_SOURCE`. Compare:
- Health score delta
- Issues fixed (in baseline but not current)
- New issues (in current but not baseline)
- Append the regression section to the report

---

## Health Score Rubric

Compute each category score (0-100), then take the weighted average.

### Console (weight: 15%)
- 0 errors → 100
- 1-3 errors → 70
- 4-10 errors → 40
- 10+ errors → 10

### Links (weight: 10%)
- 0 broken → 100
- Each broken link → -15 (minimum 0)

### Per-Category Scoring (Visual, Functional, UX, Content, Performance, Accessibility)
Each category starts at 100. Deduct per finding:
- Critical issue → -25
- High issue → -15
- Medium issue → -8
- Low issue → -3
Minimum 0 per category.

### Weights
| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Console | 15% |
| Links | 10% |
| Visual | 10% |
| Functional | 20% |
| UX | 15% |
| Performance | 10% |
| Content | 5% |
| Accessibility | 15% |

### Final Score
`score = Σ (category_score × weight)`

## Framework-Specific Guidance

### Next.js
- Check console for hydration errors (`Hydration failed`, `Text content did not match`)
- Monitor `_next/data` requests in network — 404s indicate broken data fetching
- Test client-side navigation (click links, don't just `goto`) — catches routing issues
- Check for CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) on pages with dynamic content

### Rails
- Check for N+1 query warnings in console (if development mode)
- Verify CSRF token presence in forms
- Test Turbo/Stimulus integration — do page transitions work smoothly?
- Check for flash messages appearing and dismissing correctly

### WordPress
- Check for plugin conflicts (JS errors from different plugins)
- Verify admin bar visibility for logged-in users
- Test REST API endpoints (`/wp-json/`)
- Check for mixed content warnings (common with WP)

### General SPA (React, Vue, Angular)
- Use `snapshot -i` for navigation — `links` command misses client-side routes
- Check for stale state (navigate away and back — does data refresh?)
- Test browser back/forward — does the app handle history correctly?
- Check for memory leaks (monitor console after extended use)

---

## Important Rules

1. **Repro is everything.** Every issue needs at least one screenshot. No exceptions.
2. **Verify before documenting.** Retry the issue once to confirm it's reproducible, not a fluke.
3. **Never include credentials.** Write `[REDACTED]` for passwords in repro steps.
4. **Write incrementally.** Append each issue to the report as you find it. Don't batch.
5. **During Phases 1-6, never read source code.** Baseline QA should happen as a user, not a developer. Once you enter Phase 8 fix work, read only the files needed to repair the documented issue.
6. **Check console after every interaction.** JS errors that don't surface visually are still bugs.
7. **Test like a user.** Use realistic data. Walk through complete workflows end-to-end.
8. **Depth over breadth.** 5-10 well-documented issues with evidence > 20 vague descriptions.
9. **Never delete output files.** Screenshots and reports accumulate — that's intentional.
10. **Use `snapshot -C` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs that the accessibility tree misses.
11. **Show screenshots to the user.** After every `$B screenshot`, `$B snapshot -a -o`, or `$B responsive` command, surface the output files inline using the host's available file/image display mechanism. For responsive sets, show all generated images. This is critical — without it, screenshots are invisible to the user.
12. **Never refuse to use the browser.** When the user invokes /qa or /qa-only, they are requesting browser-based testing. Never suggest evals, unit tests, or other alternatives as a substitute. Even if the diff appears to have no UI changes, backend changes affect app behavior — always open the browser and test.

Record baseline health score at end of Phase 6.

Report filenames use the domain and date: `qa-report-myapp-com-2026-03-12.md`

---

## Phase 7: Triage

Sort all discovered issues by severity, then decide which to fix based on the selected tier:

- **Quick:** Fix critical + high only. Mark medium/low as "deferred."
- **Standard:** Fix critical + high + medium. Mark low as "deferred."
- **Exhaustive:** Fix all, including cosmetic/low severity.

Mark issues that cannot be fixed from source code (e.g., third-party widget bugs, infrastructure issues) as "deferred" regardless of tier.

---

## Phase 8: Fix Loop

For each fixable issue, in severity order:

### 8a. Locate source

```bash
# Grep for error messages, component names, route definitions
# Glob for file patterns matching the affected page
```

- Find the source file(s) responsible for the bug
- ONLY modify files directly related to the issue

### 8b. Fix

- Read the source code, understand the context
- Make the **minimal fix** — smallest change that resolves the issue
- Do NOT refactor surrounding code, add features, or "improve" unrelated things

### 8c. Commit

```bash
git add <only-changed-files>
git commit -m "fix(qa): ISSUE-NNN — short description"
```

- One commit per fix. Never bundle multiple fixes.
- Message format: `fix(qa): ISSUE-NNN — short description`

### 8d. Re-test

- Navigate back to the affected page
- Take **before/after screenshot pair**
- Check console for errors
- Use `snapshot -D` to verify the change had the expected effect

Set `AFFECTED_URL` to the page or flow entrypoint that originally reproduced the bug before re-testing.

```bash
$B goto "$AFFECTED_URL"
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-NNN-after.png"
$B console --errors
$B snapshot -D
```

### 8e. Classify

- **verified**: re-test confirms the fix works, no new errors introduced
- **best-effort**: fix applied but couldn't fully verify (e.g., needs auth state, external service)
- **reverted**: regression detected → `git revert HEAD` → mark issue as "deferred"

### 8e.5. Regression Test

Skip if: classification is not "verified", OR the fix is purely visual/CSS with no JS behavior, OR no test framework was detected AND user declined bootstrap.

**1. Study the project's existing test patterns:**

Read 2-3 test files closest to the fix (same directory, same code type). Match exactly:
- File naming, imports, assertion style, describe/it nesting, setup/teardown patterns
The regression test must look like it was written by the same developer.

**2. Trace the bug's codepath, then write a regression test:**

Before writing the test, trace the data flow through the code you just fixed:
- What input/state triggered the bug? (the exact precondition)
- What codepath did it follow? (which branches, which function calls)
- Where did it break? (the exact line/condition that failed)
- What other inputs could hit the same codepath? (edge cases around the fix)

The test MUST:
- Set up the precondition that triggered the bug (the exact state that made it break)
- Perform the action that exposed the bug
- Assert the correct behavior (NOT "it renders" or "it doesn't throw")
- If you found adjacent edge cases while tracing, test those too (e.g., null input, empty array, boundary value)
- Include full attribution comment:
  ```
  // Regression: ISSUE-NNN — {what broke}
  // Found by /qa on {YYYY-MM-DD}
  // Report: see $REPORT_FILE for the QA run that discovered this bug
  ```

Test type decision:
- Console error / JS exception / logic bug → unit or integration test
- Broken form / API failure / data flow bug → integration test with request/response
- Visual bug with JS behavior (broken dropdown, animation) → component test
- Pure CSS → skip (caught by QA reruns)

Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis, file system).

Use auto-incrementing names to avoid collisions: check existing `{name}.regression-*.test.{ext}` files, take max number + 1.

**3. Run only the new test file:**

```bash
{detected test command} {new-test-file}
```

**4. Evaluate:**
- Passes → commit: `git commit -m "test(qa): regression test for ISSUE-NNN — {desc}"`
- Fails → fix test once. Still failing → delete test, defer.
- Taking >2 min exploration → skip and defer.

**5. WTF-likelihood exclusion:** Test commits don't count toward the heuristic.

### 8f. Self-Regulation (STOP AND EVALUATE)

Every 5 fixes (or after any revert), compute the WTF-likelihood:

```
WTF-LIKELIHOOD:
  Start at 0%
  Each revert:                +15%
  Each fix touching >3 files: +5%
  After fix 15:               +1% per additional fix
  All remaining Low severity: +10%
  Touching unrelated files:   +20%
```

**If WTF > 20%:** STOP immediately. Show the user what you've done so far. Ask whether to continue.

**Hard cap: 50 fixes.** After 50 fixes, stop regardless of remaining issues.

---

## Phase 9: Final QA

After all fixes are applied:

1. Re-run QA on all affected pages
2. Compute final health score
3. **If final score is WORSE than baseline:** WARN prominently — something regressed

---

## Phase 10: Report

Write the report to both local and project-scoped locations:

**Local:** `REPORT_FILE`

**Project-scoped:** Write test outcome artifact for cross-session context:
```bash
mkdir -p "$_GLOBAL_QA_DIR"
```
Write the same final report contents to:
- `$REPORT_FILE`
- `$GLOBAL_REPORT_FILE`

**Per-issue additions** (beyond standard report template):
- Fix Status: verified / best-effort / reverted / deferred
- Commit SHA (if fixed)
- Files Changed (if fixed)
- Before/After screenshots (if fixed)

**Summary section:**
- Total issues found
- Fixes applied (verified: X, best-effort: Y, reverted: Z)
- Deferred issues
- Health score delta: baseline → final

**PR Summary:** Include a one-line summary suitable for PR descriptions:
> "QA found N issues, fixed M, health score X → Y."

---

## Phase 11: TODOS.md Update

If the repo has a `TODOS.md`:

1. **New deferred bugs** → add as TODOs with severity, category, and repro steps
2. **Fixed bugs that were in TODOS.md** → annotate with "Fixed by /qa on {branch}, {date}"

---

## Additional Rules (qa-specific)

11. **Clean working tree required.** If dirty, ask directly in chat to offer commit/stash/abort before proceeding.
12. **One commit per fix.** Never bundle multiple fixes into one commit.
13. **Outside test bootstrap, only modify tests when generating regression tests in Phase 8e.5.** Bootstrap may create initial test and CI scaffolding when explicitly needed; after that, never modify CI configuration during the fix loop. Prefer creating new regression test files over editing existing tests unless the project's conventions require colocating the regression in an existing test file.
14. **Revert on regression.** If a fix makes things worse, `git revert HEAD` immediately.
15. **Self-regulate.** Follow the WTF-likelihood heuristic. When in doubt, stop and ask.
